# PokeFair

There is no more original way to learn React than making your very own Pokedéx. So that's what this is, my very own version of a Pokedéx made with React.

Feel free to take a look https://pokefair.netlify.app/

## What did I learn?
How to consume an API (GET method only), async functions and basic handle of promises.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
